# Security Lab

This repository contains the code that I use to deploy my Security Lab environment with Terraform.

## 📌 Features

**T.B.D.**

- Domain Controller running on Windows Server

## 🔧 Usage

To use code from this repository, you will need to have an Azure account and access to the Azure CLI with Terraform installed.
I heavily rely on the [terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-caf-enterprise-scale) and the [terraform-azurerm-lz-vending](https://github.com/Azure/terraform-azurerm-lz-vending) modules, hence some of the references to e.g. the management & connectivity subscriptions.
